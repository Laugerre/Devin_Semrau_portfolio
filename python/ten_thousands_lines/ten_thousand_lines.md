### Project Scope:
The objective of this project is to descover all possible python programs that are 10,000 lines of code or less. The side effect
of this mathematically impossible endeavor is to explore different searching algorithms, play with methods of performance measuring, 
and learn how to maximize output of different software, hardware, and system architectures. 


### Pre-Project Paths of exploration:
- maximizing hardware resources in python
- thinking about output/watt efficency
- thinking about scaling solutions across a network. (raspbarry pi cluster perhaps?)
- mindful software architecture
- strech goal thoughts
    - methods for evaluating programs have value. <-- stretch goal for now.
    - multiple cpu's
    - gpu hardware utilization
    - fpga hardware utilization.
