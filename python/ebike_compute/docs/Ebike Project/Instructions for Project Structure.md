Structuring your repository is crucial for maintainability, readability, and scalability. Here's a general guideline for structuring a large Python project:

1. **Top-Level Structure**:
    ```
    projectname/
    ├── docs/
    ├── projectname/
    ├── tests/
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── setup.py
    ```

2. **Details**:

    - **`projectname/`**: This is the main package where your source code resides.
        - **`__init__.py`**: Makes the folder a package.
        - **`__main__.py`**: Entry point if you want to make the package executable.
        - **`module1.py`, `module2.py`, ...**: Your source code modules.
        - **`subpackage1/`, `subpackage2/`, ...**: Any sub-packages.

    - **`docs/`**: Documentation for your project. Tools like Sphinx can help generate documentation.

    - **`tests/`**: Contains unit tests. It's a good practice to have a test suite for your project.
        - **`__init__.py`**: Makes the folder a package.
        - **`test_module1.py`, `test_module2.py`, ...**: Unit tests for your modules.

    - **`.gitignore`**: List of files and folders that should be ignored by Git. For Python projects, this often includes `__pycache__/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, and virtual environments.

    - **`LICENSE`**: The license for your project. Common choices include MIT, GPL, and Apache.

    - **`README.md`**: A markdown file that introduces your project, explains how to install and use it, and other pertinent information.

    - **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all dependencies for your project. Can be generated using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

    - **`setup.py`**: This is for packaging and distributing your project. It allows others to easily install your project using `pip`.

3. **Additional Tips**:

    - **Environment Isolation**: Consider using tools like `virtualenv` or `conda` to isolate your project's environment. This ensures that dependencies don't conflict with each other across different projects.

    - **Configuration Files**: If your project uses configuration files, consider placing them in a `conf/` or `config/` directory at the top level.

    - **Static and Media Files**: If you're building a web application, you might have static assets (CSS, JS, images). Consider creating a `static/` directory. For user-uploaded content, a `media/` directory can be useful.

    - **Database Migrations**: For projects using databases, a `migrations/` folder (often auto-generated by ORMs like Django's ORM or Alembic for SQLAlchemy) can be present.

    - **Continuous Integration**: If you're using CI/CD tools, you might have configuration files at the top level, like `.travis.yml` for Travis CI or `.github/workflows/` for GitHub Actions.

    - **Docker**: If you're containerizing your application, you'll have a `Dockerfile` at the top level, and possibly a `docker-compose.yml` if you're using Docker Compose.

4. **Tools**:
    - **Cookiecutter**: It's a tool that lets you create projects from project templates. There are many pre-existing templates for Python projects, or you can create your own.

Remember, while this is a general guideline, the exact structure can vary based on the nature and requirements of your project. Always prioritize clarity and maintainability.
